#Generic Project Starter

A basic project setup containing [HTML5 Boilerplate 3.0](http://html5boilerplate.com/), my own [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) setup, and several JavaScript libraries, including [jQuery 1.7.2](http://jquery.com/), [Modernizr 2.6.1](http://modernizr.com/), [Respond.js 1.1.0](https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond/), and [jRespond 0.7.2](https://github.com/ten1seven/jRespond). Big thanks to the original creators of those included libraries (you're awesome!).
