# Generic Project Starter

A basic project setup containing a [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) setup and several JavaScript libraries, including [jQuery 1.11.1](http://jquery.com/), [Modernizr 2.8.2](http://modernizr.com/), [Respond.js 1.4.2](https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond/), [Picturefill.js](https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill/), [jRespond 0.10](https://github.com/ten1seven/jRespond), and [Selectivizr 1.0.3b](https://github.com/keithclark/selectivizr). Big thanks to the original creators of those included libraries (you're awesome!).

Also big thanks to [Anthony Colangelo](https://github.com/acolangelo), the original author of this :)
